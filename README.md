# OthelloPython
This is my python project on the game Othello. The rules of the game are on the wiki page : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello_%28jeu%29

In this repository, there is the python code and a Compiled Pyton File which needs pygame and python installed to be run.

If pygame is not installed, check your python version and download the right pygame installer from : http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
